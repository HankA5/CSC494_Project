## Lizard Habitat Monitoring System

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-assisted IoT system that monitors a lizard’s habitat conditions and activity, such as temperature, humidity, and basic behavior indicators.

Proper environmental conditions are critical for reptile health. Temperature, humidity, and lighting must stay within specific ranges, and changes in behavior can indicate stress or health concerns. However, these conditions are usually monitored manually and inconsistently.

This project focuses on using IoT devices and AI-assisted development to improve awareness of habitat conditions rather than creating complex machine learning models.

### Problem Statement
Lizard owners often rely on manual checks to monitor enclosure conditions, which can lead to missed temperature or humidity issues. In addition, subtle changes in behavior may go unnoticed until a problem becomes serious.

This project aims to provide continuous monitoring and simple reporting to help identify potential habitat issues earlier.

### Project Goals
- Measure temperature and humidity inside the lizard enclosure  
- Collect basic activity or behavior data (e.g., movement or camera footage)  
- Store and report collected data over time  
- Allow users to view habitat conditions from a personal device  
- Use AI tools to assist with development, debugging, and learning

### Technologies and Tools (Planned)

#### Hardware
- ESP32 microcontroller  
- Temperature and humidity sensor  
- Optional camera or motion sensor  
- Breadboard and jumper wires  

#### Software
- Arduino IDE  
- Data processing and reporting scripts  
- Simple web or device-based interface  
- GitHub for version control  

#### AI Tools
- AI assistance for coding, debugging, and documentation  
- AI-assisted planning and problem-solving during development

### Project Scope
This project focuses on monitoring and reporting habitat conditions and basic activity data. It does not attempt to diagnose health issues or replace professional veterinary advice.

### Project Status
This project is currently in the planning and preparation phase. Hardware setup, data collection, and reporting features will be developed and tested in later sprints.
