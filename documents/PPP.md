## Project Overview

### Problem
Lizard habitat conditions such as temperature and humidity are often monitored manually and inconsistently. Small deviations from ideal ranges can negatively impact a lizard’s health, but these issues may go unnoticed until visible stress or behavior changes occur.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an IoT-based system that continuously monitors a lizard’s enclosure and provides clear reports on environmental conditions and basic activity data.

### Approach
Use IoT sensors to collect habitat data, with AI tools assisting in development, debugging, and data interpretation.

---

## Why

- Reptiles are highly sensitive to environmental changes.
- Manual checks can miss gradual or temporary condition changes.
- Patterns over time are more informative than single readings.

This project focuses on **awareness and prevention**, not automated diagnosis or medical conclusions.

---

## System Concept

- Sensors collect temperature and humidity data inside the enclosure  
- ESP32 processes and transmits data  
- Optional camera or motion data provides basic activity insight  
- A simple interface displays:
  - Environmental trends over time  
  - Periods outside recommended ranges  

The system supports **user decision-making**, not automated health judgments.

---

## Metrics for Progress

Project progress will be evaluated using:

- Successful collection of temperature and humidity data  
- Reliable data logging over time  
- Clear visualization or reporting of habitat conditions  
- Completion of sprint goals within the planned timeline

## Role of AI in This Project

AI tools will assist with:

- Embedded programming and sensor integration  
- Debugging hardware and communication issues  
- Explaining unfamiliar concepts during development  
- Planning and documenting project progress  

AI is used as a **learning and development assistant**, not as a predictive or diagnostic system.

- Refine system reliability  

### Activities
- Improve data presentation  
- Analyze trends in habitat conditions  
- Identify system limitations  

---

## Project Scope

### Included
- Monitoring temperature and humidity
